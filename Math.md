# Complex Variables with an introduction to CONFORMAL MAPPING and its applications

## Variables and Functions

A symbol, such as z, which can stand for any one of a set of complex numbers is called a complex variable.
Suppose, to each value that a complex variable z can assume, there corresponds one or more values of a
complex variable w. We then say that w is a function of z and write w ¼ f(z) or w ¼ G(z), etc. The variable z
is sometimes called an independent variable, while w is called a dependent variable. The value of a function
at z ¼ a is often written f(a). Thus, if f(z) ¼ z2, then f(2i) ¼ (2i)
2 ¼ 4

## The Real Number System
The number system as we know it today is a result of gradual development as indicated in the following list.
### Natural numbers 

1, 2, 3, 4, ... , also called positive integers, were first used in counting. If a and
b are natural numbers, the sum a þ b and product a  b, (a)(b) or ab are also natural numbers. For
this reason, the set of natural numbers is said to be closed under the operations of addition and
multiplication or to satisfy the closure property with respect to these operations.

### Negative integers and zero

Denoted by 1, 2, 3, ... and 0, respectively, permit solutions
of equations such as x þ b ¼ a where a and b are any natural numbers. This leads to the operation
of subtraction, or inverse of addition, and we write x ¼ a  b.
The set of positive and negative integers and zero is called the set of integers and is closed
under the operations of addition, multiplication, and subtraction.

### Rational numbers or fractions

Such as 3/4 , -8/3 , ... permit solutions of equations such as bx ¼ a
for all integers a and b where b=0. This leads to the operation of division or inverse of multiplication, and we write x ¼ a=b or a 4 b (called the quotient of a and b) where a is the numerator and b is the denominator. The set of integers is a part or subset of the rational numbers, since integers correspond to
rational numbers a/b where b ¼ 1.
The set of rational numbers is closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, so long as division by zero is excluded.

### Irrational numbers

√2 and π are numbers that cannot be expressed as a/b where a and b
are integers and b=0.
The set of rational and irrational numbers is called the set of real numbers. It is assumed that the student
is already familiar with the various operations on real numbers.

## The Complex Number System

There is no real number x that satisfies the polynomial equation x2 þ 1 ¼ 0. To permit solutions of this and
similar equations, the set of complex numbers is introduced.
We can consider a complex number as having the form a þ bi where a and b are real numbers and i,
which is called the imaginary unit, has the property that i
2 ¼ 1. If z ¼ a þ bi, then a is called the real
part of z and b is called the imaginary part of z and are denoted by Refzg and Imfzg, respectively. The
symbol z, which can stand for any complex number, is called a complex variable.
Two complex numbers a þ bi and c þ di are equal if and only if a ¼ c and b ¼ d. We can consider real
numbers as a subset of the set of complex numbers with b ¼ 0. Accordingly the complex numbers 0 þ 0i
and 3 þ 0i represent the real numbers 0 and 3, respectively. If a ¼ 0, the complex number 0 þ bi or bi is
called a pure imaginary number.
The complex conjugate, or briefly conjugate, of a complex number a þ bi is a  bi. The complex
conjugate of a complex number z is often indicated by z or z.

## De Moivre's Theorem

De Moivre's theorem gives a formula for computing powers of complex numbers. We first gain some intuition for de Moivre's theorem by considering what happens when we 
multiply a complex number by itself. Squaring a complex number, the absolute value is squared and the argument is multiplied by 2. For n≥3, 
de Moivre's theorem generalizes this to show that to raise a complex number to the n^th power, the absolute value is raised to the n^th power and the argument 
is multiplied by n.

Problems involving powers of complex numbers can be solved using binomial expansion, but applying De Moivre's theorem is usually more direct.
De Moivre's theorem is the only practical manual method for identifying the powers or roots of complex numbers

## Limit

A limit is the value that a function (or sequence) "approaches" as the input (or index) "approaches" some value. Limits are essential to calculus (and mathematical analysis 
in general) and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

Let f(z) be defined and single-valued in a neighborhood of z ¼ z0 with the possible exception of z ¼ z0 itself
(i.e., in a deleted d neighborhood of z0). We say that the number l is the limit of f(z) as z approaches z0
and write limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l if for any positive number e (however small), we can find some positive
number d (usually depending on e) such that j f(z)  lj , e whenever 0 , jz  z0j , d.
In such a case, we also say that f(z) approaches l as z approaches z0 and write f(z) ! l as z ! z0. The
limit must be independent of the manner in which z approaches z0.
Geometrically, if z0 is a point in the complex plane, then limz!z0 f(z) ¼ l if the difference in absolute
value between f(z) and l can be made as small as we wish by choosing points z sufficiently close to z0
(excluding z ¼ z0 itself).

## Infinity

By means of the transformation w ¼ 1=z, the point z ¼ 0 (i.e., the origin) is mapped into w ¼ 1, called the
point at infinity in the w plane. Similarly, we denote by z ¼ 1, the point at infinity in the z plane. To consider the behavior of f(z) at z ¼ 1, it suffices to let z ¼ 1=w and examine the behavior of f(1/w) at w ¼ 0.
We say that limz!1 f(z) ¼ l or f(z) approaches l as z approaches infinity, if for any e . 0, we can find
M . 0 such that j f(z)  lj , e whenever jzj . M.
We say that limz!z0 f(z) ¼ 1 or f(z) approaches infinity as z approaches z0, if for any N . 0, we can find
d . 0 such that j f(z)j . N whenever 0 , jz  z0j , d.

## Continuity
Let f(z) be defined and single-valued in a neighborhood of z ¼ z0 as well as at z ¼ z0 (i.e., in a d
neighborhood of z0). The function f(z) is said to be continuous at z ¼ z0 if limz!z0 f(z) ¼ f(z0). Note
that this implies three conditions that must be met in order that f(z) be continuous at z ¼ z0:

## Real Number
In mathematics, a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line (or alternatively, a quantity that can be represented as an 
infinite decimal expansion)

## Complex Number

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i satisfies the equation i2 = −1. Because no real number satisfies 
this equation, i is called an imaginary number

## Imaginary Number

An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property i2 = −1. The square
of an imaginary number bi is −b2. For example, 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is −25.
