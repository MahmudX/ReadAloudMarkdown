# Complex Variables with an introduction to CONFORMAL MAPPING and its applications

## Variables and Functions

### Function

A function tries to define these relationsips. It tries to give the relationship a mathematical form. An equation is a mathematical way of looking at the relationship between concepts or items. These concepts or items ar represented by what are called variables.

### Variable

A variable represents a concept or an item whose magnitude can be represented by a number, i.e. measured quantitatively. Variables are called variables because they vary, i.e. they can have a variety of values. Thus a variable can be considered as a quantity which assumes a variety of values in a particular problem. Many items in economics can take on different values. Mathematics usually uses letters from the end of the alphabet to represent variables. Economics however often uses the first letter of the item which varies to represent variables. Thus p is used for the variable price and q is used for the variable quantity.

### Monomial

A monomial is an algebraic expression that is either a numeral, a variable, or the product of numerals and variables. (Monomial comes from the Greek word, monos, which means one.) Real numbers such as 5 which are not multiplied by a variable are also called monomials. Monomials may also have more than one variable. 4x3y2 is such an example. In this expression both x and y are variables and 4 is their coefficient.

## The Real Number System
The number system as we know it today is a result of gradual development as indicated in the following list.

### Natural numbers 

In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering. In common mathematical terminology, words colloquially used for counting are "cardinal numbers", and words used for ordering are "ordinal numbers".

### Negative integers

In mathematics, a negative number is a real number that is less than zero. Negative numbers represent opposites. If positive represents a movement to the right, negative represents a movement to the left.

### Rational numbers or fractions

In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q. Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number.

The set of rational numbers is closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, so long as division by zero is excluded.

### Irrational numbers

In mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers which are not rational numbers. That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

## De Moivre's Theorem

In mathematics, de Moivre's formula (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity) states that for any real number x and integer n it holds that
(cos(x)+isin(x))ⁿ=cos(nx)+isin(nx), where i is the imaginary unit (i² = −1). The formula is named after Abraham de Moivre, although he never stated it in his works. 
The expression cos(x) + i sin(x) is sometimes abbreviated to cis(x). The formula is important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry.

De Moivre's theorem gives a formula for computing powers of complex numbers. We first gain some intuition for de Moivre's theorem by considering what happens when we 
multiply a complex number by itself. Squaring a complex number, the absolute value is squared and the argument is multiplied by 2. For n≥3, 
de Moivre's theorem generalizes this to show that to raise a complex number to the n^th power, the absolute value is raised to the n^th power and the argument 
is multiplied by n.

Problems involving powers of complex numbers can be solved using binomial expansion, but applying De Moivre's theorem is usually more direct.
De Moivre's theorem is the only practical manual method for identifying the powers or roots of complex numbers

## Limit

A limit is the value that a function (or sequence) "approaches" as the input (or index) "approaches" some value. Limits are essential to calculus (and mathematical analysis 
in general) and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

## Infinity

Infinity – often denoted by the symbol ∞ – represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. Since the time of the ancient Greeks, the philosophical nature of infinity was the subject of many discussions among philosophers.

## Continuity
In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, sufficiently small changes in the input of a continuous function result in arbitrarily small changes in its output.

## Real Number
In mathematics, a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line (or alternatively, a quantity that can be represented as an 
infinite decimal expansion)

## Complex Number

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i satisfies the equation i2 = −1. Because no real number satisfies 
this equation, i is called an imaginary number.

**Modulus of a complex number:** Modulus of a complex number is the distance of the complex number from the origin in a complex plane and is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the number.

## Imaginary Number

An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property i2 = −1. The square
of an imaginary number bi is −b2. For example, 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is −25.
